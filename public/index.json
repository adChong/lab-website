This investigation takes the form of an actual building\ncase study, with nine months of hourly measured building electricity use,\nWiFi connection counts as a proxy for occupancy, and actual meteorological\nyear (AMY) weather data.\n\nIn general, the accuracy of the building energy model improves with the\noccupancy and plug-loads schedule derived from WiFi data. Specifically, the\nCoefficient of Variation Root Mean Square Error (CV[RMSE]) reduced from 37%\nto 24% with an exponential improvement in the PIs quality compared to the\nresults obtained with ASHRAE 90.1 reference schedules. However, the increase\nin prediction accuracy shrank to 5% CV(RMSE) and a comparable CWC upon\ncalibrating the base loads of the reference schedules. Increasing the spatial\nresolution from building aggregated to floor aggregated occupancy data\nworsened the CV(RMSE) and CWC, suggesting trade-offs between parameter\nuncertainty and model bias/inadequacy.

Current simulation-based assessment methods simplify the occupancy related schedules by using a standard or representative set of static and homogeneous assumptions.

An institutional building located in Singapore is used for a case study. Two spatial resolution and five temporal resolution are combined to establish different base models for energy simulation, representing different accuracy levels of occupancy-related schedules. Then, a simulation workflow is performed for each ECM to determine its energy savings under different levels of input schedules. Finally, the ECM decision is determined based on the simulated energy performance and compared among different base models.

However, its actual implementation is restricted by the high configuration cost. Control-oriented model is the cornerstone of MPC and the most challenging part. Due to the paucity of a systematic understanding, it is also hard to estimate the efforts required to obtain the model. Therefore, this study aims at improving the scalability of MPC by addressing modeling-related issues and establishing an automated framework.\nWhile many past studies demonstrated the usefulness of MPC through simulation and experiments, more attention is required for quantifiable relationships between data requirement, model performance, and control performance. The data used to obtain the model and implement control is essential for the ultimate performance. However, data availability and quality vary among different buildings. Therefore, an important question for scalability is what data is necessary and/or desired. On the other hand, it is unclear how the predictive capability of control-oriented models affects the control performance. The answer to this question involves a model performance evaluation approach, which tests not just the predictive accuracy, and series of experiments to quantify the relationships.\nVirtual testbeds with single and multi-zone emulators are implemented to address the questions. Different data availability conditions are designed to obtain alternative control-oriented models. All alternatives are comprehensively evaluated in terms of prediction and control performance. Thereby, quantitative relationships between data requirement, model performance, and control performance are established. The virtual experiments are partially duplicated in an actual testbed for verification. Subsequently, a MPC framework is proposed to automatically configure and evaluate the models based on data availabilities and control purposes.

The core tools are the whole-building energy simulation programs that provide users with key building performance indicators such as energy use and demand, temperature, humidity, and costs. However, BES, with an iterative nature inside, can produce a large amount of data. The volumes of the data have overwhelmed traditional data analysis methods such as spreadsheets and ad-hoc queries with a large number of factors to be considered. Solutions in most existing software and applications have limited post-processing capacities on BES results. They are not flexible enough to enable a clear understanding and control of how the data is being transformed. There is a need to improve the efficacy and integration between data-driven analytics and BES, and efforts should be made to develop integrated tools that are capable of leveraging both methods.\nAs BES becomes more integral to many aspects of architecture design and decision-making processes, computational reproducibility has become increasingly important to researchers, designers and practitioners. Lack of credibility in BES results due to a lack of reproducibility is widely considered a problem by the energy modeling community. Issues in simulation reproducibility are mainly caused by the absence of (1) an integrated workflow between BES and data-driven analytics and (2) a portable and reusable computational environment encapsulating essential software and applications to perform it.\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces a new framework for integrating BES and data-driven analytics. The framework is different from existing ones because of its data-centric design philosophy. The objectives are:\n to provide better and more seamless integration between BES engine EnergyPlus and R-programming data-driven analytics environment through a parametric simulation prototype with structured inputs and outputs format. to build infrastructures for portable and reusable BES computational environment to facilitate reproducibility research in building energy domain.

Comparing with the isolated building system optimization, a combination of passive and active strategies is generally recognized that can result in a lower life-cycle cost (LCC) with better energy performance in the literature. With the passive design parameters being optimized, the heating and cooling load of the building could be decreased, leading to a reduction in the size of the HVAC system. for integrated building design. However, in the current cost-optimal decision-making framework, there is no difference in the costing process whether it is performed on the integrated building system or the single system energy optimization. Although the dynamic energy simulation can well demonstrate the energy benefit gained from the integrated design, the cost-benefit usually be highly underestimated due to the little considering of the effect that load reductions have on the capital and running costs of the HVAC system.\nAgainst this background, this research proposes a holistic LCC optimization approach for the integrated building design, which concerns the cost integration between passive design and HVAC costs and the tradeoff between initial investment for ECMs and long-term benefits. Three LCC optimization methods are performed for the case study and their impact on Pareto front solutions’ energy and cost performance is compared in this study. This research can contribute to a better understanding and interpretation of the cost-effectiveness in energy conservation, which is the basis for successful design decisions and policy implementation.\nTo improve energy efficiency, evaluating the energy savings potential of energy conservation measures (ECMs) is a critical task. During new buildings design or building retrofits, occupancy and plug-loads schedules can significantly impact building energy use and is a leading factor in uncertainty when determining the effectiveness of ECMs and operation strategies. Current simulation-based assessment methods simplify the occupancy related schedules by using a standard or representative set of static and homogeneous assumptions. The simplification contributes to significant gaps between the simulated and measured actual energy performance of buildings.\nThis study presents a framework for identifying and quantifying the impact of occupancy-related schedules on ECMs’ performance using building energy simulation. An institutional building located in Singapore is used for a case study. Two spatial resolution and five temporal resolution are combined to establish different base models for energy simulation, representing different accuracy levels of occupancy-related schedules. Then, a simulation workflow is performed for each ECM to determine its energy savings under different levels of input schedules. Finally, the ECM decision is determined based on the simulated energy performance and compared among different base models. This research can contribute to our understanding of the interactions between model complexity and energy efficiency design, facilitating future discussions on the right level of abstraction when modeling occupancy in building performance simulation.\n","date":1596816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596816000,"objectID":"37c625ff86c64c60d8c25d130f8b39b3","permalink":"/project/lcc/","publishdate":"2020-08-08T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/lcc/","section":"project","summary":"Life cycle cost optimization","tags":["Building Enegy Simulation"],"title":"Life cycle cost optimization","type":"project"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Song Chao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567871248,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567871248,"objectID":"3fe2fedf0a136109e8aed3feaed9fef0","permalink":"/publication/chong-2019-continuous/","publishdate":"2019-09-07T17:47:28+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2019-continuous/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A framework for the continuous Bayesian calibration of building energy models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weili Xu","Adrian Chong","Khee Poh Lam","Haopeng Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567785600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567785600,"objectID":"b1fc56c9cc3a2c6177edc9e83a52472e","permalink":"/publication/xu-2019-gbeplus/","publishdate":"2019-09-07T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/xu-2019-gbeplus/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A new BIM to BEM framework: The development and verification of an open-source gbXML to EnergyPlus translator for supporting building life cycle performance analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhan Sicheng","Adrian Chong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567785600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567785600,"objectID":"5eae38d30a7863d86b9732986073c37e","permalink":"/publication/zhan-2019-robust/","publishdate":"2019-09-07T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/zhan-2019-robust/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A robust unsupervised framework for high-resolution building energy consumption profiling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

The ability to import data from BIM and BEMS provides the potential to significantly reduce the time and effort needed for the continuous calibration of BES models. First, five gbXML geometric test cases were used to check the BIM to BES model translation. Translation of the test cases indicates good geometric agreement between the native BIM and the gbXML-based BES model. An actual building calibration case study (with BIM and three years of monthly electrical energy consumption data) was then used to evaluate the proposed continuous calibration method. The results suggest that compared to a non-continuous approach, the continuous Bayesian calibration method showed reduced prediction uncertainty and improved prediction accuracy on a test dataset. The paper also presents information and comparison of the coefficient of variance of the root mean square error (CVRMSE) and the normalized mean biased error (NMBE), recommending looking at their distributions when working with probabilistic BES predictions.","tags":["Energy simulation","Continuous calibration","Bayesian calibration","Uncertainty analysis","Building information models (BIM)","Green building XML (gbXML)"],"title":"Continuous-time Bayesian calibration of energy models using BIM and energy data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiang Zhang","Adrian Chong","Yuqi Pan","Chenlu Zhang","Khee Poh Lam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546272000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546272000,"objectID":"85d359c5a8e9e2f0aaf32275cc0e70ed","permalink":"/publication/zhang-2019472/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-2019472/","section":"publication","summary":"Whole building energy model (BEM) is a physics-based modeling method for\nbuilding energy simulation.

With measures in place to meet this 80% target, the number of Green Mark certified buildings has grown significantly from 17 during the launch of the BCA Green Mark scheme in 2005 to more than 2100 in 2014. With the exponential increase in the number of Green Mark certified buildings, there is an urgent need for the verification of their actual performance. The need to \u0026ldquo;validate performance, raise and build awareness and capability\u0026rdquo; has also been identified as one of the key initiatives of the S$52 Million Green Buildings Innovation Cluster (GBIC) Fund allocated by the Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF), in the most recent third green building masterplan released by BCA. Currently, the best practices for M\u0026amp;V are documented in several guidelines, including the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), ASHRAE Guideline 14 and M\u0026amp;V Guidelines prepared for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP). Most of these efforts are driven by the need to use a BEM to predict the savings of different Energy Conservation Measures (ECM).

Urban materials absorb solar and infrared radiation and the accumulated heat is dissipated in the atmosphere increasing further the air temperature. Roofs are envelope components which with advanced solutions such as cool roofs or green roofs can provide significant energy savings in air-conditioned buildings and improved indoor thermal conditions. By means of dynamic simulations in EnergyPlus software a numerical comparative analysis between these two solutions was done in a tropical climate like Singapore’s, taking into account climatological, thermal, optical and hydrological variables. Simulations of a typical summer day in Singapore were assessed to determine (i) UHI reductions for different green/cool roof scenarios; (ii) the diurnal heat fluxes dynamics and (iii) the buildings’ thermal energy reduction for the investigated cases. The results show that during peak periods (9 am to 5 pm) cool roofs reduce heat gain by about 0.14 KWh/m2 (8%) and green roofs mitigate considerably less to about 0.008 KWh/m2 (0.4%). And for the whole of a summer design day, cool and green roof reduces heat gain by 15.53 (37%) and 13.14 (31%) KWh/m2 respectively. The numerical simulation results confirm that an appropriate selection of roof materials contribute to the reduction of the negative effects of UHI but experimental data for air-conditioned buildings are yet to be carried out.","tags":["Green roof","Cool roof","Tropical climate","Energy efficiency","Mitigation potential"],"title":"Green and cool roofs’ urban heat island mitigation potential in tropical climate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Kathrin Menberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514736000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514736000,"objectID":"23a0c2f63f7634f54684d7ffcdaabc3f","permalink":"/publication/chong-2018527/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2018527/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper provides practical guidelines to the Bayesian calibration of building energy models using the probabilistic programming language Stan.

Using a case study, we demonstrate the application of Kennedy and O’Hagan’s (KOH) [1] Bayesian calibration framework to an EnergyPlus whole building energy model. The case study is used to analyze the sensitivity of the posterior distributions to the number of calibration parameters. The study also looks into the influence of prior specification on the resulting (1) posterior distributions; (2) calibrated predictions; and (3) model inadequacy that is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions. Results from the case study suggest that over-parameterization can result in a significant loss of posterior precision. Additionally, using strong prior information for the calibration parameters may dominate any influence from the data leading to poor posterior inference of the calibration parameters. Lastly, this study shows that it may be misleading to assume that the posteriors of the calibration parameters are representative of their true values and their associated uncertainty simply because the calibrated predictions matches the measured output well.","tags":["Bayesian calibration","Building energy modeling","Building simulation","Gaussian process","Hamiltonian Monte Carlo"],"title":"Guidelines for the Bayesian calibration of building energy models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Khee Poh Lam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483200000,"objectID":"6a476c22afa1cb96b5f4a029efee8e1a","permalink":"/publication/chong-2017-comparison/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2017-comparison/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A comparison of MCMC algorithms for the Bayesian calibration of building energy models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Khee Poh Lam","Matteo Pozzi","Junjing Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483200000,"objectID":"1e91ce185661e0cc2cc2dd9864896edf","permalink":"/publication/chong-2017343/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2017343/","section":"publication","summary":"Bayesian calibration as proposed by Kennedy and O’Hagan [22] has been increasingly applied to building energy models due to its ability to account for the discrepancy between observed values and model predictions.

This study focuses on improvements to the current implementation of Bayesian calibration to building energy simulation. This is achieved by: (1) using information theory to select a representative subset of the entire dataset for the calibration, and (2) using a more effective Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), which is an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to explore the posterior distribution. The calibrated model was assessed by evaluating both accuracy and convergence. Application of the proposed method is demonstrated using two cases studies: (1) a TRNSYS model of a water-cooled chiller in a mixed-use building in Singapore, and (2) an EnergyPlus model of the cooling system of an office building in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. In both case studies, convergence was achieved for all parameters of the posterior distribution, with Gelman–Rubin statistics Rˆ within 1±0.1.

State-of-the-art technique that couples evolutionary algorithms with a building simulation engine, which is time consuming and often cannot reach the “true” optimal solutions. Studies addressing these issues focus on implementing strategies such as fine tuning optimization algorithm's parameters, hybrid evolutionary algorithms with a local search algorithm or optimizing meta-models. Unlike the previous studies, this paper proposes two improvement strategies for building system design optimization. The two strategies, adaptive operators approach and adaptive meta-model approach, modify the behaviors of conventional evolutionary algorithms to improve the optimization convergency and speed performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these two strategies compared to conventional algorithms, a case study was conducted. The case study observed high convergency performance from both strategies with 30% and 60% time savings respectively. Furthermore, this study examines the performance comparison in respect to convergency, diversity preservation and speed between these two strategies.","tags":["Multi-objective evolutionary optimization","Building system design","Building cost estimation","Optimization performance"],"title":"Improving evolutionary algorithm performance for integer type multi-objective building system design optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Khee Poh Lam","Weili Xu","Omer T Karaguzel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451577600,"objectID":"5f4596895fc70fb4c1be45aacb50a198","permalink":"/publication/chong-2016-missing/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2016-missing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Imputation of missing values in building sensor data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weili Xu","Khee Poh Lam","Adrian Chong","Omer T.

Coupled with the need to create and develop sustainable urban developments, it is essential to understand how much the environment as well as its surrounding morphology affects the built environment. Greater emphasis should therefore be placed on urban planning which takes into consideration the surrounding environment and any accompanying effects it might have on the built environment. The integration of design tools with microclimate assessment tools therefore attest to be one with a promising future. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating the building performance of offices in Singapore whilst taking into account its surrounding morphology using GIS as a platform for integration with an urban climatic assessment tool. Hourly weather data which accounts for the urban morphology (input to the model) is obtained by morphing maximum, minimum and average temperature (the output of air prediction model STEVE) into a typical 24h profile. Good agreement was found between predicted dry-bulb temperatures and measured data. A total of two indicators of envelope performance were used and they are (1) increase in conduction (wall, window and roof) heat gain and (2) solar heat gain through glazing taking into account shading by surrounding buildings and morphology. The model was shown to have good agreement with building energy simulation programme IES-VE.","tags":["Urban heat island","Building envelope performance","Window solar heat gain"],"title":"Predicting the envelope performance of commercial office buildings in Singapore","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.

This in turn results in heavy reliance on mechanical systems especially air-conditioning to achieve thermal comfort. An alternative would be the use of evaporative cooling which is less energy intensive. Objective and subjective measurements were conducted at an experimental setup at the National University of Singapore (NUS) to evaluate the thermal conditions and thermal sensations brought about by misting fans. Field measurements were also conducted at food centres in Singapore to determine if they are coherent with the objective and subjective measurements conducted. Analysis of objective and subjective data showed that the misting fan was able to significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature and thermal sensation votes. This is consistent with field measurements taken, where regression analysis showed that with the misting fan, thermal neutrality can be obtained at a higher outdoor effective temperature (ET*). However, the reduction in temperature comes at the expense of higher relative humidity which results in consistently greater biological (bacterial and fungal) pollutants being enumerated from samples collected under the misting fan system. In some samples, the bacteria count is very much greater than samples collected under the non-misting fan, illustrating the potential for a substantial increase in biological pollutants due to the generation of mists.","tags":["Misting fan","Evaporative cooling","Singapore","Hot","Humid"],"title":"Performance evaluation of misting fans in hot and humid climate","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Welcome to Slides Academic\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three  A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/img/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
