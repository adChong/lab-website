A NUS project funded by NUS COVID-19 Research Seed Grant

COVID-19 is mainly transmitted from person to person through droplets and bioaerosol generated when an infected symptomatic person coughs or sneezes. It is known that the Air Conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation (ACMV) system have an impact on the transmission on air borne diseases as it has been proven in several previous disease outbreaks. This study aims to understand the relative influence of building operations and interventions on the risk of droplet and/or aerosol transmission and provide recommendations on how buildings can be operated under the “New Normal”.

Droplet/aerosol transmission inside a dedicated outdoor air system with ceiling fans (DOAS-CF) installed in NUS SDE4 will be investigated experimentally and numerically. A series of experiments including tracer gas tests and PIV tests will be conducted to the transmission behaviour under different operation scenarios. Following computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations will optimize the system operation and further convert it to a larger scale such as the whole building. The results will change the way we cool and ventilate buildings during an outbreak and provide guidance towards the design of buildings that are ecologically resilient.

The objectives of this research project are:
<ul>
 <li>Investigate the effect that controllable environmental parameters (humidity, dry-bulb temperature, and air velocity) have on the dispersion of droplets and bio-aerosols.</li>
 <li>Develop and calibrate a computational fluid dynamic model of the dispersion for a hybrid system using data assimilation techniques.</li>
 <li>Using the calibrated model, conduct scenario testing to determine the operation and ventilation strategies that could be used to minimise bio-aerosol dispersion in the event of an outbreak.</li>
</ul>
