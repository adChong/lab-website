Building energy simulation (BES) has been widely adopted for the investigation
of building environmental and energy performance for different design and
retrofit alternatives. Data-driven analytics is vital for interpreting and
analyzing BES results to reveal trends and provide useful insights. However,
seamless integration between BES and data-driven analytics current does not
exist. This paper presents eplusr, an R package for conducting data-driven
analytics with EnergyPlus. The R package is cross-platform and distributed
using CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network). With a data-centric design
philosophy, the proposed framework focuses on better and more seamless
integration between BES and data-driven analytics. It provides structured
inputs/outputs format that can be easily piped into data analytics workflows.
The framework also provides an infrastructure to bring portable and reusable
computational environment for building energy modeling to facilitate
reproducibility research.
