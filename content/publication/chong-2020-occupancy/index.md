Occupancy is a significant area of interest within the field of building
performance simulation (BPS). Through Bayesian calibration, the present study
investigates the impact of the availability of different spatial resolution
of occupancy data on the gap between predicted and measured energy use in
buildings. The study also examines the effect of occupancy data on the
quality of the constructed prediction intervals (PIs) using the Coverage
Width-based Criterion (CWC) metric. CWC evaluates the PIs based on both their
coverage and range. This investigation takes the form of an actual building
case study, with nine months of hourly measured building electricity use,
WiFi connection counts as a proxy for occupancy, and actual meteorological
year (AMY) weather data.

In general, the accuracy of the building energy model improves with the
occupancy and plug-loads schedule derived from WiFi data. Specifically, the
Coefficient of Variation Root Mean Square Error (CV[RMSE]) reduced from 37%
to 24% with an exponential improvement in the PIs quality compared to the
results obtained with ASHRAE 90.1 reference schedules. However, the increase
in prediction accuracy shrank to 5% CV(RMSE) and a comparable CWC upon
calibrating the base loads of the reference schedules. Increasing the spatial
resolution from building aggregated to floor aggregated occupancy data
worsened the CV(RMSE) and CWC, suggesting trade-offs between parameter
uncertainty and model bias/inadequacy. These results contribute to our
understanding of the interactions between model complexity, simulation
objectives, and data informativeness, facilitating future discussions on the
right level of abstraction when modeling occupancy in BPS.
