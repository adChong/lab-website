Whole building energy model (BEM) is a physics-based modeling method for
building energy simulation. It has been widely used in the building industry
for code compliance, building design optimization, retrofit analysis, and other
uses. Recent research also indicates its strong potential for the control of
heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. However, its
high-order nature and slow computational speed limit its practical application
in real-time HVAC optimal control. Therefore, this study proposes a practical
control framework (named BEM-DRL) that is based on deep reinforcement learning.
The framework is implemented and assessed in a novel radiant heating system in
an existing office building as a case study. The complete implementation
process is presented in this study, including: building energy modeling for the
novel heating system, multi-objective BEM calibration using the Bayesian method
and the Genetic Algorithm, deep reinforcement learning training and simulation
results evaluation, and control deployment. By analyzing the real-life control
deployment data, it is found that BEM-DRL achieves 16.7% heating demand
reduction with more than 95% probability compared to the old rule-based
control. However, the framework still faces the practical challenges including
building energy modeling of novel HVAC systems and multi-objective model
calibration. Systematic study is also needed for the design of deep
reinforcement learning training to provide a guideline for practitioners."
